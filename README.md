Just run `npm install` in the root folder. ( make sure to not use the audit fix, it will break everything )

Add your account(s) into the `config.js` file.

Edit `main.js`, by setting up the modules to run in order.
And how the settings should be.

And if needed change the module file.

And then run `node main`

# To use
## Running Modes
There is a few ways to run this.
 * RunAllBots - `core.RunAllBots(modules)` - will run all account in `config.js`
 * RunIndexSpecificBot - `core.RunIndexSpecificBot([0, 1], modules)` - will run the specifig index in the `config.js` only
 * DoRunBots - `core.DoRunBots(auths, modules)` - will run the given accounts in the auths list. ( Ignoring the `config.js` )


 The `modules` parameter: you need to push at least one module before running. Read the next section.


## Run Modules
To select what module to run. you have to add it into a list in the `main.js` file.

You just need to add the filename in the `modules`. ( if the module in a sub folder. you have to include the subfolder name separated by slash)

eks:
```js
var modules = [];
modules.push('events/salequeue');
modules.push('events/FreeDailySticker');
modules.push('profileComment');
modules.push('Wishlist_AddGame');
modules.push('GameRecommend_Add');
modules.push('ActivateFreeGame');
```

## Settings
In the `main.js` you can tweak settings the way how it should be running.
The default settings are show below. ( Also can be foung in `lib/Setting.js`).
To understand what each setting do, read about it in the [Wiki by clicking here](https://github.com/quer/the-steam-awards/wiki/Configuration)
```js
{
    AuthFieldNameUsername: "steam_user",
    AuthFieldNamePassword: "steam_pass",
    AuthFieldNamesharedSecret: "sharedSecret",
    Logging: {
        ShowTimeStamp: true,
        ShowAccountSteamId: true,
        ShowAccountName: true,
        ShowStack: true,

    },

        clusterSize: 4
    },
    Request: {
        UseQueue: false,
        Time: 1000, // 1000 is 1 sec
        Mode: Enums.Request.MinTimeBetweenRequest
    }
}
```

# Script
The scripts are made to save you time and effort for setting accounts into config.

If you do not use default settings, you have to add the setting in the files.

 * `npm run SetSpecialAccountText` -> will add the property to each account, with an index inside it.
 * `npm run ConvertFromLineFormat [FilePath]` -> will add account(s) from a text file has the format `username:password:sharedsecret:SpecialAccountText` (only username and password is mandatory)
 * `npm run Totp [index]` -> will show the username and password. and the generated totp key, to login.
